The purpose of this platform is to support the tracking of (UNICEF) programme targets through partner organizations' implementation of activities. The main problem being addressed is the difficulties in finding information about current level of implementation of programme. A less frequent, but nevertheless important, problem is uniform data collection standards. And lastly, UNICEF does not always have means of sharing information of its activities with the public.

Programme Cooperation Agreement (PCA) Tracking Tool would be the core part of the system to allow UNICEF Staff to replace the Excel PCA Tracking and remove the problem of the different versions of information. The PCA Tracking tool shall enable the monitoring of each PCA (Programme Cooperation Agreement) activities and implementation. The tool shall allow the creation of instances of PCAs with some attributes (e.g. Start and End Date, Budget, Implementing Partner NGO, the Goal it tries to fulfill, Target Number of Beneficiaries, Intermediate Results, WBS, RRP Outputs, PCA Files, Grants and Donors, etc.) as the main entity of this system. As the activities are implemented, NGOs report (monthly, quarterly) with the progress towards the agreed targets with UNICEF. Each report corresponds to one PCA and the numbers in it (i.e. Indicators) for the reporting period will update automatically the overall target number of beneficiaries.

Dashboard of Indicators will be a simple visualization of progress towards targets. Cumulative numbers of Indicators (per goal) divided by Targets (per goal) will be visualized in an easy-to-understand dashboard of work progress.

Map of Activities shall be a web-based public map with bubbles, representing PCAs, on top showing all activities of UNICEF.

THIS PLATFORM IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
